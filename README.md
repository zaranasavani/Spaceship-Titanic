#  Kaggle - Spaceship Titanic Challenge 🛸



Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project! This project is built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from medical images. The goal is to provide an AI-based solution to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors.


## 📝 Challenge Overview
Welcome to the year 2912, where your data science skills are put to the test to solve a cosmic mystery! 🪐

The Spaceship Titanic was on its maiden voyage when it collided with a spacetime anomaly, causing nearly half the passengers to disappear into an alternate dimension. Your mission is to build a machine learning model to predict which passengers were transported, using the recovered data from the ship's damaged computer system.

## 🎯 Goal
The objective of this challenge is to predict which passengers were transported to an alternate dimension using the given dataset. The dataset contains passenger records, including demographic details, spending habits, and cabin information.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, RandomForest for Model training
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for Data Analysis & Visualization
- Kaggle Notebooks & Competition Environment
- Python as the core programming language

## 📈 Model Performance & Approach
- Data Preprocessing: Missing value handling, feature engineering
- Feature Selection: Selected important features based on correlation
- Model Training: Used RandomForestClassifier & XGBoost
- Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV for optimal parameters
- Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score
